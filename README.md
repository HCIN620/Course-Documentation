NOTE: recently Professor McQuaid made minor updates to the Study Guide.  I don't know exactly where the edits were made or by how much the page numbering has changed.  Just make sure you're working with the latest version available in MyCourses or [here in our Course Documentation website.](media/book.pdf)

- Read  [**Information**, pages 75 to 93 in the study guide](media/book.pdf#page=75)

    - Shannon (1948)
    - Cover and Thomas (2006)
    - Arango (2015)

  - Professor McQuaid says, "*I (Mick) have chosen a set of topics that seem relevant to HCI specialists and have little overlap with the above-mentioned texts, so I refer the diligent reader to those texts for different perspectives.*"  I.e., you don't have to dive-in to the topic of Information Architecture, but you should be aware of what it is.
