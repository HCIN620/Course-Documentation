  - Exercise: [share best practices (p72-73)](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=72) ...note: this is *not* a graded exercise, but according to Professor McQuaid: students of HCIN-620 really enjoy doing this exercise.  However he says that he only conducted this exercise during the in-person version of the course.  Still though there's no reason we couldn't create new Channels in Slack to create ad hoc groups to do it.

*Week 6: Prototyping*

- Watch Mick's video: [Sniffy Pitch (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/j00ntqzNaIU) (5:52)
  - It is never too early to begin planning your capstone. This video is a pitch for a project that started in this class and became a capstone for the two students involved, as well as an entrepreneurial startup funded by the Simone Center. See if you can match the standard they set!
  - NOTE: as you watch the video keep in mind that this presentation about "Sniffy" came *after* HCIN-620. The presentation is full of market analysis data which is not related to HCIN-620.  Remember: this course is about **information and interaction design**!

- Read in the Study Guide
  - [Prototyping (read p59-70)](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=60) ...just start this, and finish next week<br>As always the Study Guide refers to other materials that you need to read, available as PDFs in [the **misc** section in MyCourses](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/le/content/936888/Home)
    - Sefelin, Tscheligi, and Giller (2003)
    - Hendry et al. (2005)

- TO-DO individually:
  - [*Widget Redesign*, p171-172 in the Study Guide](media/book.pdf#page=171) (due: <s>Friday, October 1</s> UPDATED: Friday, October 8)
    - Description (from p186 in the Study Guide): "Learn to identify affordance and the lack of affordance. Take the environment around an interaction into account. Work on your sense of which problems are worth solving."
    - NOTE: part of this week's exercise will have you *present your widget redesign to the class*.  Stand by for instructions about that later.
- TO-DO [as a team](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1clsjcfm6UQmgpOSfj9PMU5iLkSvYyq6xvRhagZOug/edit#gid=0):
  - Keep the focus on completing [**Milestone 2 - Contextual Inquiry** (p150-155)](media/book.pdf#page=150) (due: Friday, October 1), and in parallel...
  - Begin working on [**Milestone 3 - Personas** (p156)](media/book.pdf#page=156)



## Monday, September 20, 2021

*Week 5: Contextual Inquiry*

- Watch Mick's video: [Persona Exemplar (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/D1TE8UJ98h0) ...example of a persona (3:17)
- Read in the Study Guide
  - [Personas and Scenarios (read p58-60 in the Study Guide)](http://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=58) which includes references to other materials you need to read:
    - Cooper et al. (2014) ...not the whole thing obviously.  Refer to the Study guide with how to read it
      - Pruitt and Grudin (2003)
  - NOTE: all the materials referenced in the Study Guide^ you can find in [the **misc** area in our *MyCourses* section](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/le/content/936888/Home), under *Table of Contents*

  - TO-DO as a team:
    - If you haven't already, as a team write and post a *critique of each others' websites* in the #chatter channel in Slack
    - Complete **Milestone 2 - Contextual Inquiry** (due: Friday, October 1 *...extra week*)
      - In the Study Guide, read [Milestone 2: Contextual Inquiry, page 150-155](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=150) 
      - Note that this project is the *most important* this semester.  The success of the other milestones and final project depend on your team's ability to correctly plan, implement, and document a contextual inquiry.  There's a lot that needs to go into it; please don't try to "wing-it!"  That would negatively impact the other milestones and the final project if you do it wrong.

*Week 4: Teamwork*

- Watch Mick's video: [Teamwork (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/gbizsBUuJ8g) (13:35)

- Read in the Study Guide
  - [Contextual Inquiry (read p54-58 in Study Guide)](media/book.pdf#page=54)

- In your group
  - Prepare for Project 3 by considering *Contextual Inquiry* in your projects
  - Answer: how exactly will your team execute a *Contextual Inquiry*?  Write it down as a plan; be specific about who will do what, and when
  - You do not have to turn-in this plan but you'll need it, obviously, very soon

- Due
  - [*Picking up a key* (p167 in the Study Guide)](media/book.pdf#page=167) exercise due in MyCourses before midnight Friday
    - BTW, in case you haven't noticed, in the assignments when Prof. McQuaid refers to a reading in another book (e.g. *McCloud (2006, Chapter 1, p13)*) you know you can find that reading in [the **misc** area in our MyCourses section](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/le/content/936888/Home), under **Table of Contents**, right?
    - Please note: if you neglect to refer to the reference materials for anything in HCIN-620, it's obvious when I go to grade your assignments.  However, so far I (Prof. Kostin) have been fairly easy-going about that because things are always a little crazy when the semester starts.  But we're well underway now so my grading will be a little stricter from here on out.  So read-up!  Learn!  Don't try to wing-it. üèÉ

Also this (not mentioned in the Week 4 area in MyCourses, but you have to do this too, as a team):

- Over the next few days, each team is expected to **critique each others' websites** 
  - Submit your team's critique of the other teams' websites in [the #chatter channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T02BW1KDQSZ/C02CBLE4ERX)
  - Note, later after the critiques are in, each team must **summarize the critiques** by your classmates on your own website.  I'll send a reminder about that in Slack.

  - Then read [Milestone I: Project Focus starting page 150](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=150) in the Study Guide
  - Regarding the website
    - If someone on your team knows how to do that, then you're in good shape! Have at it. Let me know how it goes. 
    - If *no one* on your team knows how to do that, then AS A TEAM go to [my meeting scheduler (Calendly)](https://calendly.com/rkostin) to setup some time to meet with me whenever I'm available.  In Calendly, select "Business Meeting" 
    - Note: meet with me with your whole team, not individually please!
