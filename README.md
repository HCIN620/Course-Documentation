**Information and Interaction Design**

## Update: Sunday, September 12, 2021

Over the next few days, each team is expected to **critique each others' websites** using the following criteria (which comes right out of the Study Guide, p150):

Each website must identify:

- the team (including its City, where it's based)
- the targeted customer that has a problem you want to fix
- the problem
- the general direction for solution

Also over the next few days, every team must **submit a critique of the other teams' websites** in [the #chatter channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T02BW1KDQSZ/C02CBLE4ERX).  Later, after the critiques are in, each team must **summarize the critiques** by your classmates on your own website. (Note: you will need to do this for every milestone, so develop a repeatable process.) 

In addition to what's listed above^ each websites needs to:
- identify proposed stakeholders for the project
- and consider the following points about them: 
  - goals, 
  - worries, 
  - ideas, 
  - how to involve them, 
  - how to communicate progress, 
  - how to understand their way of communicating, 
  - and how to communicate the design to them. 

And finally, each website should include **a set of covenants to govern your group**. 
- These must be agreed to by all members and must specify grounds for expulsion from the group. 
- Only ten percent of all groups wind up having to enforce these, but they may help stave off disaster, so everyone should form covenants.
