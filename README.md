*Week 5: Contextual Inquiry*

- Watch Mick's video: [Persona Exemplar (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/D1TE8UJ98h0) ...example of a persona (3:17)
- Read in the Study Guide
  - [Personas and Scenarios (read p58-60 in the Study Guide)](http://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=58) which includes references to other materials you need to read:
    - Cooper et al. (2014) ...not the whole thing obviously.  Refer to the Study guide with how to read it
      - Pruitt and Grudin (2003)
  - NOTE: all the materials referenced in the Study Guide^ you can find in [the **misc** area in our *MyCourses* section](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/le/content/936888/Home), under *Table of Contents*

  - TO-DO as a team:
      - If you haven't already, as a team write and post a *critique of each others' websites* in the #chatter channel in Slack
      - Complete **Milestone 2 - Contextual Inquiry** (due: Friday, October 1 *...extra week*)
          - In the Study Guide, read [Milestone 2: Contextual Inquiry, page 150-155](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=150) 
          - Note that this project is the *most important* this semester.  The success of the other milestones and final project depend on your team's ability to correctly plan, implement, and document a contextual inquiry.  There's a lot that needs to go into it; please don't try to "wing-it!"  That would negatively impact the other milestones and the final project if you do it wrong.
