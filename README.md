*Week 8: Personal Information*

- Read [Personal information, pages 70 to 75 in the study guide](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=70), as well as the external readings linked within

However he says that he only conducted this exercise during the in-person version of the course.  Still though there's no reason we couldn't create new Channels in Slack to create ad hoc groups to do it.
