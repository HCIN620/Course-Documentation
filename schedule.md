*Week 4: Teamwork*

- Watch Mick's video: [Teamwork (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/gbizsBUuJ8g) (13:35)

- Read in the Study Guide
  - [Contextual Inquiry (read p54-58 in Study Guide)](media/book.pdf#page=54)

- In your group
  - Prepare for Project 3 by considering *Contextual Inquiry* in your projects
  - Answer: how exactly will your team execute a *Contextual Inquiry*?  Write it down as a plan; be specific about who will do what, and when
  - You do not have to turn-in this plan but you'll need it, obviously, very soon

- Due
  - [*Picking up a key* (p167 in the Study Guide)](media/book.pdf#page=167) exercise due in MyCourses before midnight Friday
    - BTW, in case you haven't noticed, in the assignments when Prof. McQuaid refers to a reading in another book (e.g. *McCloud (2006, Chapter 1, p13)*) you know you can find that reading in [the **misc** area in our MyCourses section](https://mycourses.rit.edu/d2l/le/content/936888/Home), under **Table of Contents**, right?
    - Please note: if you neglect to refer to the reference materials for anything in HCIN-620, it's obvious when I go to grade your assignments.  However, so far I (Prof. Kostin) have been fairly easy-going about that because things are always a little crazy when the semester starts.  But we're well underway now so my grading will be a little stricter from here on out.  So read-up!  Learn!  Don't try to wing-it. üèÉ

Also this (not mentioned in the Week 4 area in MyCourses, but you have to do this too, as a team):

- Over the next few days, each team is expected to **critique each others' websites** 
  - Submit your team's critique of the other teams' websites in [the #chatter channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T02BW1KDQSZ/C02CBLE4ERX)
  - Note, later after the critiques are in, each team must **summarize the critiques** by your classmates on your own website.  I'll send a reminder about that in Slack.

  - In the Study Guide, read about [Milestones starting on page 146](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=146).  These are your team "projects" - high-stakes assignments on which you'll need to focus your efforts throughout the semester.
  - Then read [Milestone I: Project Focus starting page 150](https://docs.hcin620.org/media/book.pdf#page=150) in the Study Guide
  - Regarding the website
    - If someone on your team knows how to do that, then you're in good shape! Have at it. Let me know how it goes. 
    - If *no one* on your team knows how to do that, then AS A TEAM go to [my meeting scheduler (Calendly)](https://calendly.com/rkostin) to setup some time to meet with me whenever I'm available.  In Calendly, select "Business Meeting" 
    - Note: meet with me with your whole team, not individually please!
