*Week 4: Teamwork*

- Watch Mick's video: [Teamwork (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/gbizsBUuJ8g) (13:35)

- Read in the Study Guide
  - [Contextual Inquiry (read p54-58 in Study Guide)](media/book.pdf#page=54)

- In your group
  - Prepare for Project 3 by considering *Contextual Inquiry* in your projects
  - Answer: how exactly will your team execute a *Contextual Inquiry*?  Write it down as a plan; be specific about who will do what, and when
  - You do not have to turn-in this plan but you'll need it, obviously, very soon

- Due
  - [*Picking up a key* (p167 in the Study Guide)](media/book.pdf#page=167) exercise due in MyCourses before midnight Friday
    - BTW, in case you haven't noticed, in the assignments when Prof. McQuaid refers to a reading in another book (e.g. *McCloud (2006, Chapter 1, p13)*) you know you can find that reading in the **misc** area in our MyCourses section, under **Table of Contents**, right?
    - Please note: if you neglect to refer to the reference materials for anything in HCIN-620, it's obvious when I go to grade your assignments.  However, so far I (Prof. Kostin) have been fairly easy-going about that because things are always a little crazy when the semester starts.  But we're well underway now so my grading will be a little stricter from here on out.  So read-up!  Learn!  Don't try to wing-it. üèÉ

Also this (not mentioned in the Week 4 area in MyCourses, but you have to do this too, as a team):

- Over the next few days, each team is expected to **critique each others' websites** 
  - Submit your team's critique of the other teams' websites in [the #chatter channel in Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T02BW1KDQSZ/C02CBLE4ERX)
  - When critiquing the other teams' websites, use the following criteria (which comes right out of the Study Guide, p150): each team's website must identify...
    - the team (including its City, where it's based)
    - the targeted customer that has a problem they want to fix
    - the problem
    - the general direction for solution
  - In addition to what's listed above^ each websites needs to:
    - identify proposed stakeholders for the project
    - and consider the following points about them: 
      - goals, 
      - worries, 
      - ideas, 
      - how to involve them, 
      - how to communicate progress, 
      - how to understand their way of communicating, 
      - and how to communicate the design to them. 
  - And the other teams' website should include **a set of covenants to govern their group**


Also note, later after the critiques are in, each team must **summarize the critiques** by your classmates on your own website.  I'll send a reminder about that in Slack.
