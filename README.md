*Week 6: Prototyping*

- Watch Mick's video: [Sniffy Pitch (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/j00ntqzNaIU) (5:52)
  - It is never too early to begin planning your capstone. This video is a pitch for a project that started in this class and became a capstone for the two students involved, as well as an entrepreneurial startup funded by the Simone Center. See if you can match the standard they set!
  - NOTE: as you watch the video keep in mind that this presentation about "Sniffy" came *after* HCIN-620. The presentation is full of market analysis data which is not related to HCIN-620.  Remember: this course is about **information and interaction design**!
